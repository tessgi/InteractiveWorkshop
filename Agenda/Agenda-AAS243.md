**NASA’s TESS Mission Interactive Data Workshop**
  
*AAS 243 Meeting – New Orleans, LA*

*New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, Room 219*

*Saturday Jan 06, 2024 9am - 5pm CT* 

NASA’s TESS mission (launched in 2018) provides the community with high cadence, optical
time-series across the sky, with nearly continuous observations lasting between 27 days and
one year. TESS operations have been extended through at least September 2025, and so TESS
will continue to provide time-series data for users on hundreds of thousands of targets, as well
as Full Frame Images of >2000 square degrees of the sky each month. These observations
provide valuable resources for a wide range of astronomy; the detections of exoplanets, the
investigation of stellar variability, the identification of extra-galactic transient events, the study
of AGN, and more.

This full day workshop is presented to the community to learn about TESS, learn how to obtain
data (and research funding!) through the TESS General Investigator Program, and learn how to
quickly get to work with the data, all of which is available with no exclusive access period. This
workshop is ideal for both new and established users of TESS data. New users can expect to
learn where to get started with obtaining and using data. More experienced users can expect to
learn about the 200s observing mode and updated analysis techniques. We strongly encourage
participation from scientists at all career-stages, working on extragalactic astronomy, stellar
astronomy, exoplanet astronomy. We additionally encourage attendance from anyone
interested in proposing for TESS observations.

The workshop will consist of; i) short talks introducing the NASA TESS mission ii) explanations of
how to propose for TESS observations and obtain research funding in upcoming proposal calls
iii) tutorials on working with TESS data and iv) an interactive work-with-the-experts session to
show you how to work with TESS data on your own targets. Please bring a laptop for this in
person interactive session!
