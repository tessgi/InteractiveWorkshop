**NASA’s TESS Mission Interactive Data Workshop**
  
*AAS 245 Meeting – National Harbor, MD*

*Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Room: National Harbor 2*

*Saturday 11th Jan - Sunday 12th 2025, 9am - 5pm ET* 

NASA’s TESS mission (launched in 2018) provides the community with high cadence, opBcal
Bme-series across the sky, with nearly conBnuous observaBons lasBng between 27 days and
one year. TESS operaBons have been extended through September 2025, and so TESS will
conBnue to provide Bme-series data for users on hundreds of thousands of targets, as well as
Full Frame Images of >2000 square degrees of the sky each month. These observaBons provide
valuable resources for a wide range of astronomy; the detecBon of exoplanets, the invesBgaBon
of stellar variability, the idenBficaBon of extra-galacBc transient events, the study of AGN, and
more.

This two-day workshop is presented to the community to learn about TESS, learn how to obtain
data (and research funding!) through the TESS General InvesBgator Program, learn how to
quickly get to work with the data - all of which is available with no exclusive access period, and
learn about TIKE - a JupyterHub service provided by the STScI which can help you access and
analyze your TESS data. This workshop is ideal for both new and established users of TESS data
and TIKE. New users can expect to learn where to get started with obtaining and using data.
More experienced users can expect to learn about the 200s observing mode and updated
analysis techniques. We strongly encourage parBcipaBon from scienBsts at all career-stages,
working on extragalacBc astronomy, stellar astronomy, exoplanet astronomy. We addiBonally
encourage aZendance from anyone interested in proposing for TESS observaBons.

The workshop will consist of; i) short talks introducing the NASA TESS mission ii) explanaBons of
how to propose for TESS observaBons and obtain research funding in upcoming proposal calls
iii) tutorials on working with TESS data iv) how to work with TIKE and to opBmize your script for
the cloud v) interacBve work-with-the-experts sessions to show you how to work with TESS data
and TIKE for your own targets. Please bring a laptop for these in person interacBve sessions!
