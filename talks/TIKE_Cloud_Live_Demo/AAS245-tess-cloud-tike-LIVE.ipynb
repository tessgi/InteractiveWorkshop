    "## What is TIKE?\n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE stands for the *Timeseries Integrated Knowledge Engine*.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE uses a web-based platform, called JupyterHub, to allow you to run [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and other software \"on the cloud\" using your web browser: you don't need to install anything on your local computer. TIKE has access to a cloud copy of the [MAST Archive](https://archive.stsci.edu), enabling anyone to access and analyze data from NASA's [TESS mission](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess). We also have copies of other mission datasets, including data from HST, GALEX, and PanSTARRS. They are generally cataloged in full on the MAST Public Datasets page, so check there for an updated list.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE is continually maintained and updated by humans, so if you run into issues please let us know. Don't hesitate to send us your suggestions for packages and tutorials, either through the [MAST help desk](mailto:archive@stsci.edu) or the [tike_content repository](https://github.com/spacetelescope/tike_content)."

    "## What is the \"cloud\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"cloud\", or cloud computing, refers to the practice of remotely accessing computing resources, rather than hosting them yourself. This term might also be used to refer to software and databases running on those servers. As Randall Munroe put it, \"turns out the cloud is just other people's computers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, \"the cloud\" is the AWS East Datacenters in northern Virginia. TIKE runs in proximity to this copy of MAST data. This means that the data is not transmitted over the internet, but rather within a data center. This leads to faster access, since data centers have high-quality (likely fiber optic) connections between their machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would I want to work on the cloud?\n",
    "Using the cloud has several benefits; principally, as mentioned above, there's no need to download data to your local machine. This speeds up data access, and allows you to perform analyses that wouldn't be possible without a major upgrade to your hard drive capacity or internet service. You can access data whenever and wherever you want to, from any device, as long as you have an internet connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "![tike-cloud](TIKE-Cloud-Photo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between working on the cloud and working on TIKE?\n",
    "Although you might choose to work directly with data stored on the cloud, it can be complex to configure such a system. TIKE handles this complexity, making it as easy as opening a Jupyter Notebook."

    "2. A traditional download to your local machine from the cloud-hosted copy of MAST\n",
